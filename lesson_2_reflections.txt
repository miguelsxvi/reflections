-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden directory name ".git" is created, where information about the 
history of my files will be stored from the moment I choose what files to 
commit. I need to do it or else I will not be able to save commits, and then
I will not take advantage of the benefits of git.
-------------------------------------------------

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The stagin area seems to be the like a storage room before the goods are shipped 
so when the truck comes, it just takes everything there is in the room. It is the 
company's duty to put the right items there beforehand. The working directory is
where everything is stored, say like the whole building, and the (git) repository 
would be a paper where the manager keeps track of all shipments so far. Since the
repository also keeps some other stuff (I assume) so it can recover previous 
versions, maybe the concept of document is a little bit to shallow, but let's leave
it like that for now, maybe later on as I learn more about its nature I will change it.
--------------------------------------------------------------

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

When one is about to make a commit to save the current status of the file after supposedly
have done a "logical change", to be sure that the change is significant enough to be
commited the good action is run "git diff --staged" which compares the file in the staging 
area and the latest commit. If one chooses to continue working on the file because
the modifications done were not that relevant, later on (after saving the file) they can 
compare via "git diff" (without arguments) the saved version in the working directory and 
the version in the staging area, pass the first to the staging area and compare again 
as previously said. Obviously, there is no need to be so meticulous.
