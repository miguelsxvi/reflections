-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden directory name ".git" is created, where information about the 
history of my files will be stored from the moment I choose what files to 
commit. I need to do it or else I will not be able to save commits, and then
I will not take advantage of the benefits of git.
