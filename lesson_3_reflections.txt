-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

What comes to my mind is a collaboration project, or an opensource project. Nevertheless
I have also seen it as a form of online learning resource website, where students can upload
their assignments and pull the necessary files for the activities from the server.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

According to the video, because it would be likely that those actomatic updates of the GitHub
repository would include commits of features which are not fully polished. Nonetheless, in the
case of a collaboration project, it would not be too much of a deal, since most probably a 
team could be working on a feature at a distance. Also, as long as the master or oficial branch
is well defined and all the people who have access to the repository know that there might be
other branches where the commits do not coincide with fully functional changes to the code, there
should be no problem with automatic updates. But then again, the obligation to manually upload
the changes forces the programmer/s to keep everything organised.
